This readme file is for Floyd's Algorithm for the shortest path of all pairs.

Input file:
The input file (named input.txt) should contain a distance matrix with non-negative integers for distances. All of the diagonal entries should be zeroes.
These should be separated by spaces for columns and by lines for rows.

Output file:
The output file (named output.txt) should contain the distances for each pair with the shortests paths. This will be represented in a matrix.

Compilation:
To compile FloydAlgorithm, type 'javac FloydAlgorithm.java'

Running:
To run FloydAlgorithm, type 'java FloydAlgorithm.java'
