This readme file is for the MergeSort and QuickSort algorithms.

Input File:
The input file (named input.txt) should contain the vertices from set V in the first row. This should be in the form of an array, with each element separated by a space.
The second row should contain the vertices from set U in the same formatting as the first row.
Starting on the third row, you should start constructing the adjaceny matrix. This should also be in the form of an array, with each element separated by a space.

Output File:
The output file (named output.txt) will contain a maximum matching of the input bipartite graph. This will be in the same format as the input file.

Compilation:
To compile MaximumBipartiteMatching, type 'javac MaximumBipartiteMatching.java'

Running:
To run MaximumBipartiteMatching, type 'java MaximumBipartiteMatching.java'
