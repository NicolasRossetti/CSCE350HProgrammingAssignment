This readme is for the MaxHeapBottomUp and MinHeapBottomUp algorithms.

Input File:
In the first line of the input file (named input.txt), enter the total number of keys for the heap.
The second line should contain the unsorted keys, separated by spaces. Each of these keys must be an integer.

Output File:
The output file (named output.txt), will contain an array of the inputs in input.txt. The way the heap is constructed depends on if the MaxHeap or MinHeap algorithm is used.

Compilation:
To compile MaxHeapBottomUp, type 'javac MaxHeapBottomUp'
To compile MinHeapBottomUp, type 'javac MinHeapBottomUp'

Running:
To run MaxHeapBottomUp, type 'java MaxHeapBottomUp'
To run MinHeapBottomUp, type 'java MinHeapBottomUp'
